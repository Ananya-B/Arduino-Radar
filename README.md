# Arduino-Radar
Unlike the conventional radars the one that has been constructed is used only to determine the direction in which the object has been placed, within the radar’s field.
It requires some hardware to be executed as a working model. These include: 
•	Arduino Mega 2560
•	Servo Motor
•	Ultrasonic sensor HC- SR04
•	Breadboard and Jump Wires
